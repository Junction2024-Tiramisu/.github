# SPOT
### SPOT
SPOT is a web service that uses information obtained from POSCO Holdings' All IoT Taxi to identify locations preferred by insects (especially love bugs) and allows users to check walking routes that avoid these areas.

### Characteristics of Love Bugs and Other Insects
There are two main characteristics, and this service uses both to identify locations preferred by insects:

- They follow exhaust fumes
- They are attracted to light
### Data Usage
By understanding these insect characteristics, we have created a Bug Free map that is updated in real-time daily, using normalized and standardized taxi operation data (for exhaust fumes) and light sensor information (for light).

### Website
Based on this information, we have developed a Bug Free map that users can directly check. The service guides users to identify locations (Spots) where insects are likely to be abundant during walks and suggests route modifications. After arrival, user feedback is collected to improve future learning and provide more detailed information.

This approach aims to improve citizens' lives and demonstrate how data can be directly applied to people's daily experiences.

### Future Improvements
This information can significantly improve citizens' daily lives beyond simply providing route guidance. For example:

- Enjoyable outdoor activities: When planning various outdoor activities such as park walks, jogging, or outdoor dining, people can choose locations and times with fewer insects, leading to more pleasant experiences.
- Health promotion: Citizens can enjoy outdoor exercise without the discomfort caused by insects, potentially leading to increased physical activity and improved health.
- Mental health improvement: Stress-free outdoor activities positively impact mental health. By providing opportunities to be closer to nature, it can enhance psychological stability and happiness.
- Enhanced social interaction: People can spend time outdoors with friends or family without worrying about insects, strengthening social bonds and promoting community activities.
- Improved daily convenience: By minimizing insect-related discomfort in daily outings and commutes, the overall quality of life can be enhanced.
Prevention of allergies and health issues: This is particularly useful for citizens sensitive to or allergic to insects, helping to prevent health problems in advance.
- Urban planning improvements: Using this data can lead to better urban planning, contributing to long-term quality of life improvements for all citizens.
In this way, information about insects and urban ecosystems can directly improve citizens' daily lives and play a significant role in increasing the sustainability and life satisfaction of the city. This goes beyond providing simple convenience, becoming an important tool to help citizens live more harmoniously with their urban environment.
